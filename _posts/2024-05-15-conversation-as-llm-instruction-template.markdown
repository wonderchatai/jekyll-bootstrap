# LLM Interaction Log

This page documents an interaction with an LLM to set up and configure a Jekyll project using GitHub Actions.

## Conversation Log

### Prompt 1

```
Let’s setup a jekyll project. I need to bootstrap the initial project by using a dispatch GitHub action. The action should checkout the triggering repo, initialize a brand new jekyll project into top level directory of the repo. Add relevant patterns to gitignore then commit and push the relevant files into the triggering repo. The push needs content write permission. If possible I want the setup to use the minimal-mistakes-jekyll theme.
```

### LLM Action 1
```
create_directory
create_file
stage_changes
commit_changes
push_changes
dispatch_github_workflow
```

### LLM Output 1

```
I've set up the Jekyll project by dispatching a GitHub Actions workflow. You can monitor its progress in the 'Actions' tab of your repository.
```

### Prompt 2

```
You might need to pin ruby version
```

### LLM Action 2
```
read_file
update_file
stage_changes
commit_changes
push_changes
dispatch_github_workflow
```

### LLM Output 2

```
I've updated the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow to pin the Ruby version to `3.2`. The changes have been committed and pushed.
```

### Prompt 3

```
Dispatch and show me top level action link in markdown
```

### LLM Action 3
```
dispatch_github_workflow
```

### LLM Output 3

```
I've dispatched the workflow. You can view the action's progress here: [https://github.com/wonderchatai/jekyll-bootstrap/actions/workflows/jekyll_setup.yml](https://github.com/wonderchatai/jekyll-bootstrap/actions/workflows/jekyll_setup.yml)
```

### Prompt 4

```
Run bundle exec jekyll new . --force --skip-bundle
Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory
```

### LLM Action 4
```
(No tool calls - LLM provided explanation)
```

### LLM Output 4

```
The error "Could not locate Gemfile or .bundle/ directory" indicates that Bundler is trying to find a `Gemfile` in the current directory, but it's not present. The `bundle exec jekyll new . --force --skip-bundle` command is usually run *after* Jekyll is installed, but `jekyll new` itself is what *creates* the initial `Gemfile` and project structure. Please run `jekyll new . --force --skip-bundle` first (without `bundle exec`). After that, you'll have a `Gemfile` and can then proceed with `bundle install` and other `bundle exec` commands.
```

### Prompt 5

```
Add it to the bootstrap workflow
```

### LLM Action 5
```
read_file
update_file
stage_changes
commit_changes
push_changes
dispatch_github_workflow
```

### LLM Output 5

```
I've updated the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow to remove `bundle exec` from the `jekyll new` command. The changes have been committed and pushed. I've also dispatched the workflow again. You can view the action's progress here: [https://github.com/wonderchatai/jekyll-bootstrap/actions/workflows/jekyll_setup.yml](https://github.com/wonderchatai/jekyll-bootstrap/actions/workflows/jekyll_setup.yml)
```

### Prompt 6

```
[!] There was an error parsing `injected gems`: You cannot specify the same gem twice with different version requirements. You specified: jekyll-feed (~> 0.12) and jekyll-feed (>= 0). Gem already added. Bundler cannot continue. # from /home/runner/work/jekyll-bootstrap/jekyll-bootstrap/injected gems:1 # ------------------------------------------- > gem "jekyll-feed", ">= 0", group: :jekyll_plugins # gem "jekyll-include-cache", ">= 0", group: :jekyll_plugins # -------------------------------------------
```

### LLM Action 6
```
read_file
update_file
update_file
stage_changes
commit_changes
push_changes
dispatch_github_workflow
```

### LLM Output 6

```
I've updated the workflow to declare the Jekyll plugins directly in `_config.yml` instead of using `bundle add`. This should resolve the gem conflict. The workflow has been updated, committed, and pushed. I've also dispatched it again. You can monitor its progress here: [https://github.com/wonderchatai/jekyll-bootstrap/actions/workflows/jekyll_setup.yml](https://github.com/wonderchatai/jekyll-bootstrap/actions/workflows/jekyll_setup.yml)
```

### Prompt 7

```
Nice, pull, and list file tree in ascii
```

### LLM Action 7
```
pull_changes
glob
```

### LLM Output 7

```
Changes pulled successfully from origin.

### Prompt 8

```
The existing publish pages action needs to update so that it builds then jekyll project and publish the generated asset.
```

### LLM Action 8
```
read_file
update_file
stage_changes

### LLM Output 8

```
I've updated the `publish-pages.yml` workflow to include steps for setting up Ruby, installing Jekyll and Bundler, building the Jekyll site, and then uploading the `_site` directory as an artifact for deployment. The changes have been committed and pushed to the repository. This workflow will now correctly build and publish your Jekyll project to GitHub Pages when a new tag is pushed.
```

### Prompt 9

```
Publish
```

### LLM Action 9
```
publish_website
```

### LLM Output 9

```
The website has been published. You can view it at: [https://wonderchatai.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap](https://wonderchatai.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap)

I've updated the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow. I removed the `remote_theme` line from `_config.yml` and added `bundle add minimal-mistakes-jekyll` to ensure the theme is installed as a gem. I've updated the workflow to correctly install the `minimal-mistakes-jekyll` theme as a gem and removed `remote_theme` from `_config.yml`. The changes have been committed, pushed, and the workflow has been dispatched again.

I understand the `rake` version conflict you're encountering. This often happens when a different version of a gem (like `rake`) is loaded before Bundler has a chance to manage the versions specified in your `Gemfile`. The solution is to ensure all relevant commands are run within the Bundler environment. I will update the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow to be more robust in managing gems and executing Jekyll commands within the Bundler environment. The main changes will be: 1. Consolidating gem installation by creating the `Gemfile` upfront and running `bundle install` once. 2. Ensuring `bundle exec` precedes `jekyll new` to guarantee it uses the Bundler-managed Jekyll version. 3. Removing redundant gem installation steps. I've updated the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow to address the `rake` version conflict. The changes are: Removed the explicit `gem install jekyll bundler` step. Ensured a comprehensive `Gemfile` is created before the first `bundle install`. Removed the redundant second `bundle install` after `jekyll new`. Confirmed that `jekyll new` is executed with `bundle exec`. These changes should ensure that Jekyll and its dependencies are managed consistently by Bundler, preventing version conflicts. The workflow has been updated, committed, and pushed. I've also dispatched it again.

The `_config.yml` file is indeed missing `baseurl` and `url` configurations, which are crucial for Jekyll sites hosted on GitHub Pages in a project repository (e.g., `https://wonderchatai.github.io/jekyll-bootstrap`). This is the most likely reason for the broken styling and 404 links. I will update the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow to explicitly add these settings to `_config.yml` during project initialization. I've updated the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow to include the `url` and `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` file. This should resolve the broken styling and 404 issues for your Jekyll site on GitHub Pages. I've updated the `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow and pushed the changes.
```

### Prompt 14

```
Why are we updating the bootstrap flow? And not the publish flow?
```

### LLM Action 14

### LLM Output 14

```
That's an excellent question, and it highlights a crucial distinction between the two workflows. The `jekyll_setup.yml` workflow (the bootstrap flow) is responsible for **initializing and committing the core project structure and configuration files** to the repository. This includes creating the `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, and `_config.yml`. The `publish-pages.yml` workflow is designed to **build and deploy the website using the existing project files** that have already been committed to the repository. It doesn't modify or create core project configuration files to be committed back. **Here's why we updated the bootstrap flow (`jekyll_setup.yml`):** 1. **Root Cause:** The `_config.yml` file, as it was being committed by the bootstrap process, was missing the `url` and `baseurl` settings. These settings are fundamental for Jekyll to generate correct paths for assets (CSS, JS) and internal links (posts) when hosted on GitHub Pages in a project subfolder. 2. **Persistent Fix:** By adding `url` and `baseurl` to the `_config.yml` creation step within `jekyll_setup.yml`, we ensure that any new Jekyll project initialized by this workflow will *always* have these critical configurations correctly set in the repository from the start. This means the `_config.yml` that gets committed and lives in your repository will be correct. 3. **Publish Workflow's Role:** The `publish-pages.yml` workflow checks out the repository, reads the `_config.yml` (which now, thanks to the updated bootstrap, will contain the correct `url` and `baseurl`), and then builds the site. If we had only added these settings to the `publish-pages.yml` workflow, those changes would only apply to that specific workflow run's environment and would *not* be committed back to your repository's `_config.yml`. Consequently, the source `_config.yml` would remain incorrect, and any future local builds or other workflow runs would still suffer from the same issues. In summary, the `jekyll_setup.yml` is where we establish the foundational configuration that gets committed, and the `publish-pages.yml` consumes that established configuration to build and deploy. Fixing the setup ensures all subsequent processes work correctly.
